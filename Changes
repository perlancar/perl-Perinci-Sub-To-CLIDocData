Revision history for Perinci-Sub-To-CLIOptSpec

0.01     2014-10-10 (PERLANCAR) - not yet released

         - First release. This is part of an effort to refactor Perinci-To-Doc.
           This distribution is separated so it can have minimal dependencies
           (e.g. to be used by Perinci-CmdLine-Lite).
