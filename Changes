Revision history for Perinci-Sub-To-CLIOptSpec

0.02    2014-11-20 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add arg_spec for each opt (to show e.g. values of 'in' clause
	  from schema, etc).

	- Add 'default' for each opt.


0.01     2014-11-20 (PERLANCAR)

         - First release. This is part of an effort to refactor Perinci-To-Doc.
           This distribution is separated so it can have minimal dependencies
           (e.g. to be used by Perinci-CmdLine-Lite).
